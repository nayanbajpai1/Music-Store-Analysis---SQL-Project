# Music-Store-Analysis---SQL-Project

## Objectives :
We leverage SQL to analyze data, providing actionable insights that illuminate the store's business growth trajectory through insightful answers to key questions.

The database comprises 12 interconnected tables, each representing distinct facets of the music store's operations. These tables are intricately linked, forming a comprehensive network that captures various aspects such as inventory, sales, customer data, and more, enabling a holistic understanding of the store's activities and performance.
